I have been teaching Infant Aquatic survival since 2015. I have dedicated my skills to saving children from drowning.

My focus is on teaching infants, toddlers and young children proper survival skills in the water. I am determined and dedicated to helping children have the confidence and the tools they will need to develop a love for swimming.

Aside from being the only Certified Infant Aquatics Instructor within a 75-mile radius, I am certified in adult, child & infant CPR | First Aid | Red Cross Certified Lifeguard | Automated external defibrillators or AED.

I wholeheartedly believe this program can save lives of the children in our community.

Please feel free to call or message me anytime with questions, I would love to hear from you.
