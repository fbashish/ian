My love for the water started very young even tough I'm from Montana. Along with my love for children it was a natural fit to teach swimming. I've been teaching swim lessons for over 20 years but it wasn't until 2005 that I learned about Infant Aquatics unique style of teaching. Immediately, I knew it was for me! Their swim-float-swim technique is the best program for non-swimmers to learn water safety at a young age.

I've been teaching children in the Southwest Florida area for the last 10 years. I travel to you making it extremely easy to provide your child with one of the most important life skills they will ever need, survival swimming.

The lessons are 10 minutes a day, 4 days per week and it takes around 4-6 weeks to learn the swim-float-swim technique. I'm passionate about teaching kids to swim and the water. If I'm not in the swimming pool you can find me in the ocean scuba diving for fossilized shark's teeth or hunting Florida's invasive Lion Fish!
