Hello everyone and welcome to my website! I am Marci Harmon, founder of Little Fins Swim School, LLC located in Central Florida. I have taken my passion of swimming to a whole new level by starting Little Fins.

I was a competitive swimmer for 9 years, I started lifeguarding at age 16 and continued doing that when I moved to Orlando from Northern Indiana (Notre Dame country, Go Irish!). In 2007 I was offered a position with the Florida Department of Health- Osceola County to be their first Drowning Prevention Coordinator. My job was to inform and educate the residents and visitors of Osceola County about keeping their children safe in and around bodies of water, including bath tubs and buckets. Unfortunately due to budget cuts this position was eliminated in 2009, but my passion for this did not lessen.

I learned about Infant Aquatics through all of my contacts I had created in Central Florida. I finally decided that I would not truly be happy until I was teaching children how to be safe in and around the water full time. I decided to attend the PediaSwim Academy at Southwest Aquatics with Joy McGinty in October 2010. I am so glad I took the plunge because I thoroughly enjoy what I do each and every day and I look forward to swimming with your child soon! I have been a CPR & First Aid Instructor for the American Heart Association since 2007.

Thank you for visiting and do not hesitate to ask questions!
