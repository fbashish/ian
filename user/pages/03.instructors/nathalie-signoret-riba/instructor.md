Hello, my name is Nathalie Signoret, I was born and grew in Mexico City, but I lived in Laredo Texas from 1992 to 2012. I graduated from Texas A&M International University with a Bachelors Degree in Psychology. I am a mother of 3 boys. Laredo is a very hot city during spring and summer, and we enjoy being in the pool to cool off. Because of this, in 2002, I decided to become a Swimming Safety Instructor in the American Red Cross. Since then I've been teaching children ages 3 and up and giving "mommy and me" classes for infants.

In 2010, I decided that I should train with Infant Aquatics. The Infant Survival Technique teaches infants from 6 months to 6 years of age, how to swim-float-swim in any situation. I completed a rigorous training program in Dallas, Texas, with Instructor Beverly Steinfink, R.N ; as my supervisor, over 100 hours in-water training and over 100 hours learning the physiology, psychology, and development of the child between the ages of 6 months to six years of age as they apply to swimming and water survival. The American Red Cross also certifies me in adult, child and infant CPR and First Aid.

Since then, I've been teaching year round courses to many children in Laredo, Texas. Then, in 2013, my family and I moved to Mexico City and I am happy to teach the technique with babies in the northwest area of Santa fe, Bosques de las Lomas, Interlomas, and Lomas de Chapultepec.

The second accidental death in Mexico for infants and children is drowning. In Mexico, 77% of drowning children had been seen 5 minutes before they feel Sin the pool. I feel it is very important to give children the ability to survive on their own in the water, and build a positive foundation for lifelong water enjoyment. I would love to share this gift of swimming with your family.
