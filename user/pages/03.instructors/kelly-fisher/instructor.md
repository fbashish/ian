The last few years have been extremely rewarding and busy. My husband and I sold our last home and bought a house in Scarborough Perth Western Australia, we desperately wanted a house with a pool and also close to the ocean as we both love the outdoors and being in the water. We also have two beautiful, wild and active children a little girl, Raphielle (5yrs old) and a son, Kalani (3.5 years old). Both my children did the survival swimming course through Stacy from Waterwise Perth, WA.

Stacy our instructor, is also my Mothers youngest sister (my Aunty). Last summer Stacy began instructing in our home pool and I watched her with numerous babies and children as they did their survival swimming courses. It was phenomenal to watch these children do the program and like my kids, go from sinking non swimming kids to happy floating safe swimmers. I know how proud I was when my children did the program, but it was even better watching other mothers experience the same growth and pride of their children's progress in just 6 weeks. It was then that I realised this is exactly what I wanted to do.

I have been in the Real Estate industry for the past 10 years and I have always enjoyed it, but over the last 12 months as my children have started school, the long hours I have been putting into Real Estate have not been working out for me and my family. This summer with Stacy using our home pool again, it all came together. I wanted to do something that is important and life changing.

Survival Swimming is so rewarding to teach, and I absolutely love watching these children gain life changing swimming skills. I really lucked out to have had the opportunity to be trained by Infant Aquatics founder [Judy Heumann](/instructors/judy-heumann/). Her absolute dedication to teaching me everything I needed to know and her enthusiasm and willingness to want to share all her business experience with me was so generous, Judy was never too busy to discuss any questions I had. Watching how much the parents, the children and her staff all respect Judy was truly inspirational. I know I have much to learn and there will be many challenges along the way... but I am ready!!!
