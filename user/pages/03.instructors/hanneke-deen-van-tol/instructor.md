Geboren Zwemmers (Born Swimmers) is where you give your infant water survival skills in weeks of time! In these private swim lessons your child will learn how to roll on his back and float in deep water for an undefined amount of time. Fully clothed and in swimwear. When your child is walking I will teach him or her to swim-float-swim. With these aquatic swim skills your child is able to swim to you, to the side of the pool or the stairs and get out of the water.

This program is based on 40 years of experience in teaching infants and toddlers motoric skills with the end result of a higher chance of being able to survive in the water. A perfect mix in methods is used, every child learns his or her way and is in a different stage in development.
