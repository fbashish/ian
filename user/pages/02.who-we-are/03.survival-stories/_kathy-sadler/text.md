** No Splash**

We always make it a practice to close the pool cover immediately after we are finished swimming to protect our small twins. But one day last summer, when the twins were just 2 years old, I failed to close the cover and instead began working in the garden. A few minutes later, I heard one of the twins crying wildly. I looked over to see that he had fallen in the pool but had pulled himself out. Before having lessons in (your) program he would not have known what to do, and I could not have helped him because I never even heard him fall in...there was not even a splash. Because of the lessons, he knew to right himself in the water, open his eyes to find
the side of the pool, swim to it and pull himself out. It scared us both to death, but I was thrilled that he had developed the skills to save himself in an emergency.
