## What's Next?
### Beyond Survival Swimming

Once your infant, toddler or child has completed our aquatic survival swimming program, we encourage you to continue with age-appropriate group classes. Each class is designed to enhance previously learned skills, bring your child to the next swimming level, and achieve our goal of safe, happy, technically sound swimmers.
