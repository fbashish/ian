## Why Infant Aquatics?

Children are naturally drawn to pools, hot tubs, lakes, ponds, streams, reservoirs and beaches. Despite a parent's best efforts at supervision, it only takes one head turn before an accident has occurred. Teach your baby or toddler to rescue himself in an aquatic emergency.

#### Reasons to Get Started
- You want your child to learn to swim and float in weeks, not years.
- You or your extended family live or vacation around backyard pools or natural bodies of water.
- You enjoy swimming and want your child to enjoy it as well.
- You would rather take control of your child's safety than take chances.

#### Your Child Deserves the Lifetime Gift of Swimming Safety.
