## What is Survival Swimming?

** The ability of a baby to float and breathe, regardless of the water's depth, for an indefinite period of time. **

#### How would your child react alone in the water?
The most essential survival swimming skill we will teach your child is to roll from a face-down position in the water to a face-up independent back float. Infants and toddlers cannot raise their heads to take a breath. If your child falls face down into the water, knowing how to roll onto a face-up back float can save a life! If your baby is walking, then he/she can also learn to swim to the pool edge or steps, rolling over to breathe whenever air is needed.

Roll over breathing is a technique that many schools and learn-to-swim teachers don't even attempt because it takes time, skill and patience. But once children learn to roll over to float, relax and breathe whenever air is needed, they can truly swim, stay afloat, conquer fear and experience the joy of swimming.
