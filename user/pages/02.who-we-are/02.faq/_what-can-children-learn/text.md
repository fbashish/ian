## What Aquatic Survival Skills Can Children Learn?

### Infants six to twelve months can learn to:
- hold their breath in the water
- roll from a face-down position to a face up back float
- float, relax and breathe until rescued by an adult
- perform these skills fully clothed

Particularly active infants may also learn to propel a short distance through the water between two parents. Learning these skills takes approximately 12 to 20 lessons.

### Children who are walking (1-6 years) can learn to:
- hold their breath in the water
- swim with their face in the water to the steps, side, or parent
- roll over onto their back when they need to breathe
- flip back onto their tummy to continue swimming until reaching their destination, or roll to their back should they need to breathe again
- perform these skills fully clothed

The timeframe for mastering these skills is typically 16 to 24 lessons.
