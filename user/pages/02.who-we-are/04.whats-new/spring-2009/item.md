Leah ElenWelcome to Le'a Holst, a registered nurse from Colorado Springs. Lea was born and raised in Hawaii, and hopes to retire there in the near future. She is the mother of 5 daughters, with many grandchildren. She has been teaching swimming to older children for some time, and wanted to learn how to teach babies as well. Her caring, gentle nature is a wonderful asset to her teaching abilities. Aloha Le'a!

Danielle Ruis swim instructorDanielle Ruais began helping our Frisco instructor with her stroke development lessons and discovered that she loved teaching swimming. Also a new mother, Danielle used to do event planning, but wanted something closer to home after the birth of her 2 children. She now teaches year round in a pool in Allen, bringing needed skills to children in the Allen, Frisco and Mckinney area of the Metroplex. Danielle is funny and creative and will be an asset to Infant Aquatics for a long time to come.
