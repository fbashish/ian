After 35 years teaching babies and children to swim in residential pools, condominiums, health clubs, retirement communities, scuba shops and hotels, Judy Heumann decided it was time to have her own dedicated pool. Swim•Float•Swim! opened on September 7. The facility features colorful kites suspended over a large 90 degree saline pool and a permanent equipment deck for our amazing toys and floats. The space is equipped with a parent observation deck, two bathrooms, four changing rooms, reception/snack area with vending machines and movies, employee lounge and to the delight of all, a specially designed children's play area. The only problem is getting kids to leave the building! For more pictures go to www.swimfloatswim.com
