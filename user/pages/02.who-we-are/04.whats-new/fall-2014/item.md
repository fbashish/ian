The autumn leaves are turning and Infant Aquatics has another new instructor. Hanneke Deen-van Tol completed her training in October and becomes our second instructor from the Netherlands. Hanneke worked in both the hospitality and automotive industry while becoming an avid scuba diver and PADI open water scuba instructor. In 2012, she discovered Infant Aquatics and chose to combine her love of water with her passion for teaching children to safely enjoy the water. Hanneke is expecting her first baby in March and is excited to be a member of the Infant Aquatics team.
