We are proud to announce the addition of an outstanding new instructor to our ranks. Michaele Mather, currently an RN at St. Joseph Hospital in Denver, trained with Judy Heumann in January and February. As a mother of a toddler, and an RN working with mothers and babies in Labor and Delivery and the NICU, Michaele is passionate about the importance of teaching aquatic survival to infants and young children. During her training, it was evident that Michaele has a true gift for working with children. She plans to return to her home state of New Jersey in the near future and serve the areas of Morris and Passaic counties and writes: 

> "I'm very excited about the opportunity to take the skills I already possess as an RN working with babies, and apply them as a swim instructor with Infant Aquatics/Swim-Float-Swim!"
