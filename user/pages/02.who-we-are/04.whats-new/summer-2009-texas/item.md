[Aquatots, Dallas](#)

Ashley Goolsby, from Pearland , is our newest addition. Ashley will be serving the Pearland , Friendswood, Clear Lake areas near Houston. Ashley is calm, decisive and works well with others. An engineer who worked for NASA, Ashley decided that teaching infant swimming would be a good fit for her; she is an expectant mother who was introduced to infant aquatics by another of our outstanding Houston instructors, Monika Wroblewska. Ashley 's school is called Wee Swim. Call her if you live south of the Houston area.
