Jolyn Anderson is filling the great need for Infant Aquatics in Denver. After earning her degree in Speech Pathology from Indiana University, Jolyn spent time working with children & adults with special needs, and then fell into special events & meeting planning, which afforded her the opportunity to travel the world. Expecting her first child, Jolyn wanted a career that would fit with her role as a young mom and provide Denver area families with lifesaving water skills. Welcome Jolyn!
