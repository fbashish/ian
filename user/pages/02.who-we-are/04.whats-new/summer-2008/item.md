**Texas**
[Aquatots, Dallas](http://infantaquatics.com/bevsteinfink.htm)

Texas Aquatic Survival is off to a great year. Aquatots in Dallas has trained another 3 instructors for Texas. **Gail Harris** will be teaching in the Woodlands and other surrounding cities, **Margie Williamson** will offer classes in the San Antonio area including Devine, Tx, and **Kim Emery** will be teaching in Decatur, Tx. This brings the number of teachers up to 8 in the Texas area; we are slowly but surely offering lessons to more areas of the state, and we have now expanded to Mexico which makes us an interntional group. Please look for an instructor in the area nearest you. We have instructors in Dallas, Ft. Worth, Frisco, San Antonio, and Houston.
