[Scott Virden](/instructors/scott-virden), a certified USA swim coach with decades of experience coaching competitive swimmers and teaching stroke mechanics, traveled from Kansas City to train with Judy Heumann this fall. Scott is the father of three grown children, and has a degree in Education and Physical Education. He will be bringing his newly acquired skills back to his swim team, Kansas City Swim Academy, to provide essential water safety skills to the youngest members of his community.

To accommodate an ever increasing demand for lessons at Swim•Float•Swim! Judy also trained Debbie Torok to join her staff. Debbie brought her grandchildren to lessons and was amazed at what they were able to learn in only a few weeks. Debbie's love for children and water, and passion for teaching make her a natural fit and perfect addition to our team.
