**Colorado**
[Infant Aquatics Boulder/Longmont](#)

Leslie Harrison of Pittsburg, Kansas completed her training this fall with Judy Heumann. Leslie is a mom of three young boys who left them in the care of dad to travel to Colorado for 6 weeks of training.

Leslie writes "During my training, my homesickness was replaced with a sense of accomplishment in being able to provide children with REAL lifesaving skills and to offer families in my community clear expectations of what their children will learn during lessons."

We are excited that Leslie has joined the growing number of new Infant Aquatics instructors and will be bringing her skills to her hometown as well as the not so distant city of Joplin, Missouri.

During the first week of December, Judy Heumann returned to Aspen to do refresher lessons with the Aspen students she taught last spring. Having two master instructors in the water with the kids not only produced great results -- everyone had a blast. Judy is looking forward to returning to Aspen for a month in the spring for another round of lessons with new students and refreshers. See the article Aquatic Youth Rock the Aspen Club for details.
