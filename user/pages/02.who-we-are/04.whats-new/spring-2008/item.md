**Boulder**
[Swim Float Swim](http://swimfloatswim.com)

To keep up with ever-growing demand for lessons, Judy Heumann is proud to announce that **Carlene Schumacher** has completed her training and is adding a new dimension to our staff. Carlene is a retired elementary school teacher who brought her infant grandson to lessons four years ago while his mom was on vacation. Witnessing the progress of her two grandchildren convinced her that she wanted to teach babies to swim. Carlene's calm, sure hands and gentle touch are a wonderful asset when working with little ones. Welcome Carlene!
