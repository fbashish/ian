**Dallas, Texas**

For three days in November, 15 new instructors from across the U.S. and Mexico were welcomed into the fold of Infant Aquatics by senior instructors during a poolside conference. Together we shared business strategies and teaching techniques while forging bonds of friendship with the many new instructors. Helpful in this enterprise were many of our outstanding students. Here's what some of the attendees had to say:

> I loved the networking part of it, meeting other instructors, getting new ideas andlearning from othersthat have been doing this for a while is so helpful.
