Summertime brought new and former trainees from around the world to Swim Float Swim! Cathy Williams, from South Africa and Brian Mitchell, from Arizona, completed their training in July. Cathy, a lifelong HR profesional, will be joining her son-in-law Brendan Varrie at B's Swim School in Johannesburg. Brian, a physical education teacher, has set up Goldfish Swim Academy and will be serving families throughout the greater Phoenix/Scottsdale area. It was a pleasure to train both of these wonderful individuals and to gain their friendship.

Ada Yip, from Hong Kong, returned for a visit in August. It was wonderful to reconnect since her training 18 months ago. Judy is looking forward to seeing her and all of her other trainees in November at the Infant Aquatics Continuing Education Conference in Atlanta.

Kelli Burney from Wichita Falls, TX is Infant Aquatics latest edition. She has a Bachelor's Degree in Business Management from Midwestern State University and moved to the Richardson, TX area 5 years ago where she began working for a major Insurance Company. Realizing that she and her husband want to start a family of their own, Kelli set out to explore other opportunities. After hearing some of her hometown friends talk about the need for Survival Swimming in the area, she started doing some research. Quickly she came upon Infant Aquatics and was immediately intrigued. Kelli is a lifelong swimmer, former lifeguard, and enjoys soccer and fitness.

Welcome Gaby Garza and Katie Pace. Gaby, a graphic designer with a master's degree in education, completed her training with Bev Steinfink in June and immediately began teaching for Ana Karina at ENAI, in Monterrey, Mexico. Katie, a lifelong swimmer with a background in psychology, is looking forward to bringing Infant Aquatics to Austin. Both Gaby and Katie love working with children and are excited to be able to teach them lifesaving survival skills.

We are also excited to announce two new instructors to the website. Nicole Becker will be serving the Friendswood and Pearland, Texas areas. Nicole is a mother of three and is active in Special Olypmics swim program. Lindsey McClain in the mother of three boys and will be serving the Lake Conroe, Texas area. Both ladies are wonderful additions to the Infant Aquatic Survival team.

In April, instructors from Mexico and Louisiana got together for a mini- training session to hone their skills. Present were Ana Cardenas, Chelo Valenzuela, Gaby Garza, Claudia Montemayor, Wendy Harlen, and Bev Steinfink,RN, Lead Instructor from Dallas, Texas. Students got the best ever instruction for all these teachers and everyone learned something. Coincidentally, a news crew came with reporter and camera person, and both the Louisiana and Monterrey Mexico schools were to able to explain the mission of Infant Aquatics, in the U.S. and now internationally. Our biannual conference will be in November in Atlanta.
