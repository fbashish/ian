Boulder County, Colorado

We are proud to announce the addition of Monika Chiappetta to the Infant Aquatics team. Monika completed her training with Judy Heumann in July and will be bringing her talents to the western suburbs of Chicago. Monika writes "I started swimming competitively on our neighborhood swim team at the age of 5 and have not left the pool deck since!" After finishing her collegiate swimming career and earning a Masters Degree in school social work, she became a head coach for a local high school. She is a licensed school social worker and the mother of two young boys. Monika is a gifted instructor with an infectious personality. It was a treat to have her at the pool every day and she is sorely missed by parents and kids alike. We wish her the best and would love to have her return some day!
