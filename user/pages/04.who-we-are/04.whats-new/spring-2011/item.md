Home of Infant Aquatics
Boulder County, Colorado

Since opening her own dedicated teaching facility in Longmont last fall, the demand for lessons led Judy Heumann to train two new instructors to join her existing staff. Julie Reiff joins Infant Aquatics as a parent of Beckett (3 years) and Tegan (9 months). After attending several sessions of Rec Center lessons with Beckett in 2009, Julie enrolled in Infant Aquatics so that Beckett could learn aquatic survival skills. She enjoyed swimming with Beckett so much that she decided that she would like to spend time in the water teaching other children these skills. Julie is a professional dog obedience trainer who is very talented in recognizing the needs of each child during lessons.

The spring session was so busy that Judy was also able to train her eldest son Derek as an instructor. Derek has a Masters degree in environmental law, and was interested in learning the teaching methods his mother has been developing for the past 35 years. Derek has a gentle, fun way of interacting with the children, who all adore him. Welcome Julie and Derek!
