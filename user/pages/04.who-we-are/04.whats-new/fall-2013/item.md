This fall brought instructors from Vietnam and Albuquerque to Infant Aquatics. Jessica Sanchez MD and Tuyen Ho are two of the brightest, most gifted individuals that Judy Heumann has ever had the privilege to train. Jessica chose to replace a career in medicine with a future devoted to saving lives in the water. She writes: "In medicine we are always helping people find a way to prevent illnesses or tragic events from occurring. This program is surely a step in the right direction because it teaches children essential water skills and helps to jump start a healthy life."

Tuyen traveled half-way around the world to learn to teach lifesaving water safety skills. An honor student on scholarship at universities in New Zealand and Vietnam, Tuyen spent the past 5 years as a foreign currency trader at HSBC Bank and then decided to pursue a more meaningful life path. Tuyen writes: "With many rivers and a long coastal line, Vietnam has the highest fatal drowning rate in the region. More than 11,000 children die of drowning every year. These figures are heart-breaking, and I believe that bringing Infant Aquatics to Vietnam is essential and just the right thing to do."

It has been an honor to train both of these women. All of us at Swim•Float•Swim! hate to see them leave, but are thankful for their friendship.

The fourth national Infant Aquatics Conference brought together instructors from across the US and Mexico for an educational and fun weekend devoted to maintaining our reputation as the premier swim program in the world for teaching infants and toddlers to swim. The conference afforded instructors over 12 hours of in-water education where we learned new and creative techniques for teaching infants and young children to safely enjoy the water. We added a stroke workshop aimed at transitioning children from swim-float-swim to technically correct freestyle and backstroke. It was a great way for new instructors to be introduced to veterans, with the opportunity to share ideas and provide instructors with continuing education to better serve their communities and achieve their mission of water safety, drowning prevention and producing outstanding young swimmers. We're looking forward to our next conference in Atlanta, featuring a special needs curriculum and a workshop on butterfly and breaststroke.
