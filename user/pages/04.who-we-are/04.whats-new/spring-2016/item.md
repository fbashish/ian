**Australia and California Instructor Training Certification at Swim•Float•Swim!**

Kristin Tabb and Cheryl Klatt completed certification in Infant Aquatic Survival℠ in May. Kristin joins the staff at Swim Float Swim! in Longmont, Colorado and Cheryl joins Jolyn Anderson's team at the Swim School of Denver. They are both highly skilled and caring instructors who forged close bonds with their students during their instructor certification experience. We are proud to have them represent Infant Aquatics℠ in their new profession.
