Boulder County, Colorado

Infant Aquatics continues to expand across the U.S. A packed schedule enabled Judy Heumann to conduct a double training with Kirk Weatherby of Bend, Oregon and Krissy Slanco of Austin, Texas. Kirk, a fitness coach and new father, impressed everyone with his gentle demeanor and winning smile. Krissy, a pre-school teacher/director and former nanny is a natural fit for our profession. Kirk and Krissy did an outstanding job and were loved by their students and parents. They are looking forward to educating their communities on the importance of providing effective self rescue swim lessons to children. The staff at Swim Float Swim enjoyed working with them during their training and wishes them the best.

Along with Kirk and Krissy, we are pleased to welcome Sarah Blink to the Swim Float Swim team. Sarah is a mom of three teenagers with a true talent for teaching aquatic survival. She exhibits a unique combination of calmness and energy in her teaching style. After training during the spring, she has been working a double shift this summer -- and will be taking over Carlene's early morning schedule. Carlene, who has been doing the 6:00 a.m. to noon shift for the past 5 years, will move to a more relaxed late afternoon schedule. She is looking forward to sleeping in beginning in September!

The summer season culminated with our 2nd annual Back to Pool Party. This was a special day devoted to celebrating the accomplishments of our swimmers, complete with live music, face painting, balloon twisting, food trucks and of course swimming! Thanks to our amazing staff for a wonderful year. It is truly a privilege to work side by side with each one.

Stacy Gower excelled in her coursework and is back in Perth teaching the community's infants and toddlers to swim-float-swim for safety and fun through her swim school, WaterWise. Stacy is a wonderful student and will continue to educate her community as to what is possible in aquatic self rescue for children.

Texas Infant Aquatics is getter bigger and better every year. We would like to announce the introduction of Barbara Throne to the central and western Fort Worth area. Barbara found Infant Aquatics as a result of her two grandchildren taking swimming from Jennifer DeLa Cruz in Bedford. A sculptor, artist, and long time scuba diver and water enthusiast, Barbara decided that teaching swimming would benefit her community and give her a new career path which involves both her love for children, the water, and her care giving talents. Barbara had been an adult caregiver for a number of years. Barbara is a real go-getter and a wonderful asset to our IA community.

Water safety with ReginaMeet Regina Rodriguez, San Antonio's new Infant Aquatics instructor. Regina is a mother of three and a former teacher with a degree in early childhood education. Regina discovered and trained with Infant Aquatics after witnessing several frightening pool incidents with her own child. These incidents made her acutely aware of water safety issues involving children. We are so fortunate to welcome Regina to our group of skilled, caring instructors.

The greater Houston area gets another instructor, Melissa Stoll. Melissa lives in Cypress, TX and became interested in Infant Aquatics after one of her two children took swimming lessons. she decided that Infant Aquatics was a great fit for her area; she and her "hubby" have long been in the pool business, but now he will build them and she will teach the lessons. Melissa is calm and deliberate and really has a way with children. She will be a wonderful asset to Cypress and the Infant Aquatics team.
