**Texas**

There is exciting news out of Texas! As you all know, Texas is a big state, and we need many more instructors to teach infants and toddlers here. Toward that end, we would like to announce that we have 2 new instructors; Nathalie Rojas, will be serving the greater Laredo area. Nathalie is fluent in Spanish and will be assisting us in that regard as we have students both from Texas and Mexico who speak Spanish. Nathalie's school is Laredo Infant Aquatics, and you can [click here](/instructors/nathalie-signoret) to find her contact information on this site.

Also, Leslie Fiscus, will be teaching in CorpusChristi and surrounding areas. Leslie is right on the ocean, where there is much concern about water safety. Leslie will really be an asset to our south Texas area with KidSwim USA. She will be up on the website soon.

A change for those who follow the website regularly: Ana Cardenas has moved to Louisiana. Ana taught in Monterrey, Mexico, and was very successful. However, love got in the way and Ana got married. To reach Ana, who serves Thibideaux and Baton Rouge, [click here](/instructors/ana-karina). Ana is fluent in Spanish -- now she needs to learn a little Cajun.

Interested in becoming an instructor? Let us know. We need instructors in Houston, Austin, and Southlake. Read about us at [texasinfantaquatics.com](http://www.texasinfantaquatics.com/).
