My name is Nicole (Mears) Becker. I am a native Houstonian and longtime Friendswood resident. I am the proud owner of Infant Aquatics Friendswood. As a mother of three, I know all too well how important it is to teach infants and children water safety at an early age.

All of my children learned how to swim at a very young age. My oldest child has Down syndrome and swims for Special Olympics. My youngest daughter swims competitively year-round for the Friendswood Sharks, where she holds many team records. My son just turned 3. He absolutely loves the water and can already save himself if he fell or was pushed in a pool.

Like many growing families in Friendswood, my husband and I built a pool in our backyard a couple of years back. We installed the usual safety measures to keep our son safe-pool alarm, door buzzer, elevated gate locks, etc. While we took precautions, we always knew in the back of our minds someone could accidentally leave the backdoor open or he could fall in someone else's pool that wasn't as ""careful"" as us. It was a real concern, so I put him in infant survival swim lessons before he was 2 years old. It was during this 6-week period that I realized my love for children and my love for the water could be combined to make the perfect career!

I attended the University of Houston, I am a Captain on the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo's Special Children's Committee, and I'm also one of the head coaches for the Friendswood Special Olympics Swim Team. I am also certified in adult, child, & infant CPR, AED, and First Aid. I am also a certified American Red Cross Water Safety Instructor.

Call or email me today to schedule life-saving aquatic training. Waiting until your child is older and more comfortable around water isn't an option.
