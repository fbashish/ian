My name is Tuyen and I am the founder and instructor at Baby Fish Swim Academy - home of Infant Aquatics - in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I am proud to be the first certified Infant Aquatic Professional in Vietnam and to bring this unique and effective technique of teaching infants, toddlers and young children to swim back to my country.

Leaving my doctor dream behind, in 2008, I joined HSBC Bank Vietnam as a Foreign Exchange Trader position. Being in the financial market and working with numbers every day for more than 5 years, I never stopped thinking about my dream and always wanted to do something different, something better and something more meaningful. One day, I stumbled upon a video clip on Youtube showing a toddler boy falling into the water, who was able to roll over and float on his back. That amazing ability caught my attention immediately, and I started to do more research until I found Ms. Judy Heumann and Infant Aquatics. And that was when I found my dream job!

With the ultimate goal of bringing down the alarming drowning rate in Vietnam and helping kids discover the joy of swimming at the same time, I traveled half around the world to learn this unique teaching technique. I was directly trained under Ms. Judy Heumann, founder of Infant Aquatic Survival and executive director of Infant Aquatics, LLC in Longmont, CO for 200+ hours with more than 30 kids. I was also certified by the American Heart Association for First Aid, CPR and AED program.

Please feel free to visit my website, call me or email me anytime for lessons. Together, we can make a difference!
