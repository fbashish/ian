Ali is excited to bring this amazing program to our area. As a mom of four small children, she knows first hand the importance of water safety skills for kids. After enrolling her first child in survival swimming lessons at age two, she knew right away that this was something she wanted to bring to others. Five years later with three more children completing the program, the next step was to become a certified instructor. She is grateful to have found Infant Aquatics and is committed to reducing the likelihood of aquatic tragedies in her community.

Parents take many precautions to keep their children safe. We spend countless dollars on car seats, baby gates, cabinet locks, baby monitors and more. However, drowning is the number one cause of preventable death for children under 5. Water survival lessons are often overlooked. Babies and children who are able to sit and roll over on their own are able to learn to float, starting from 6 months of age. There are water dangers all around. Beaches, ponds, lakes, friend's pools and even bathtubs are all hazards.

Ali has 2 close friends that each had a near death experience with their children. In one instance, a parent was home but the child got out of the house and through the safety gate. The eleven year old sister was the only witness. Thank god she didn't panic and knew what to do. She swam to the bottom of the pool, dragged her little brother out and performed CPR (which she had seen on TV). He lived. The second incident was when two friends were at a pool party with their two children. The parents looked away for an instant and without a sound (drowning children do not splash or make noise) their four-year old son was at the bottom of the pool. Thankfully someone noticed and he was pulled out to safety quickly. However, there have been too many children that weren't as lucky. One child is too many when drowning is preventable. Some parents may feel apprehensive to enroll their children in these lessons, some don't have the time and some simply don't know about them. However, at Swimfinity we believe every single child should be provided lifesaving skills while developing a love for swimming. Ask yourself, how would your child react if they were faced with an aquatic emergency?

Prior to being a stay at home mom, Ali spent 10 years in National Broadcast Television Advertising. She first worked at Grey Advertising in NYC as a National Broadcast Media Supervisor and then moved to MTV Networks, Nickelodeon Advertising Sales. She has a Bachelors of Science in Psychology from Sacred Heart University.

In addition to her 100 hours in water Infant Aquatics Survival Certification, she has her 200 Hour Yoga Alliance Certification, American Red Cross First Aid and CPR certifications.
