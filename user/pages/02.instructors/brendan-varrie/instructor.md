Brendan Varrie was the first instructor in Johannesburg and South Africa to introduce the Infant Aquatics programme. After many years of playing competitive waterpolo his love and enjoyment of the water led him to open B's Swim School in Bryanston Johannesburg in 2005. B's has been providing swimming instruction to children in the area from ages 6 months up to 13 years of age. We have always had a strong stroke correction section and welcome the Infant aquatics programme as a better and faster solution to teaching children aquatic survival skills.

The importance of getting children water safe in South Africa can't be overemphasized due to our warm weather and the accessibility to swimming pools. The drowning statistics in South Africa are simply overwhelming and unfortunately most infant swimming instruction focuses on getting children comfortable in the water long before they have the required skills to survive.

From purely a swimming perspective The Infant Aquatics programme provides an amazing foundation to build confident and proficient strokes as our little ones approach school going age.
