Sarah is extremely proud to be a Certified Infant Aquatics Instructor. Sarah also maintains Pediatric First Aid and CPR Certifications.

Sarah can teach your baby/infant/child survival swimming in just 4-6 weeks:

- 6-12 months old - "Roll-to-Float" technique. Roll from a face-down position in the water to an independent floating position on back.
- 12+ months old - "Swim-Float-Swim" sequence. Swim with face in water, roll onto back and float on back to breathe, roll onto belly again and swim to edge of pool for safety.
- 4-6 years old - "Swim-Float-Swim" sequence and beginner strokes.

**Sarah's Story:**
After Sarah and her husband had their twin girls, they purchased a home with a backyard pool. As an Emergency Room Physician, Sarah's husband has seen many water related injuries, and also near-drownings. They wanted to make sure their babies were as safe as possible in and around their pool (and other sources of water). Sarah and her husband researched multiple swim programs trying to find the best "survival" swim program for their babies. They enrolled their twin girls in the Infant Aquatics program when they were 1Â½ years old, and within 6 weeks they could both swim across the pool unassisted by performing the "swim-float-swim" technique. After completion of the 6-week program, Sarah was confident that her children could put themselves in a safe situation (back-float or "swim-float-swim" to the edge of the pool) in the instance of an accidental fall into the water.

Sarah instantly realized how valuable this program was for young children and their families. She decided to leave her former career as a CPA to become a certified instructor so she could teach this technique to as many young children as possible in her community. As a mother of young children, Sarah says that the survival swim program was the best program she has ever enrolled her children in, and the best money she has ever spent. Sarah believes all children should not only be able to protect themselves in case of an emergency, but also truly develop a sense of joy when in the water.

Let Sarah give your child the gift of swimming and give you the gift of peace of mind!
