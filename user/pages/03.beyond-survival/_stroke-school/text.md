# Strokes n' Floats

### The Right Foundation
The swim • float • swim sequence serves as the foundation for learning correct stroke technique. Children who can swim and float are able to transition into stroke development with ease.

### When is Your Child Ready?
This class serves as a transition between FunDays and Stroke School and is the ideal way to introduce more advanced skills to accomplished 4 year olds.

### Why Strokes n'Floats?
- To continue your child's aquatic learning process using techniques that are an extension of the swimming and floating skills previously learned.
- To keep the fun in swimming by combining beginning elements of backstroke and freestyle with the activities used in FunDay classes.
- To empower your child with more proficient swimming ability.
