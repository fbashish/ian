# Fun Days

### Who's Ready for FunDays?
Children 2.5 to 4 years who have completed private lessons and have mastered the ability to swim-float-swim.

### Why FunDays?
- Children need to practice their skills to maintain confidence and improve retention.
- Aquatic professionals agree upon the importance of play in the learn-to-swim process and the negative effects of time spent out of the water.
- FunDays are an aquatic adventure that will change your child from a survival swimmer into a recreational swimmer, and perhaps even a swim team participant.
- The structure and curriculum vary according to instructor, but include an exciting array of water toys, animal floats and games. Whatever the age or activity, your child will have such a good time that he probably won't want to get out of the pool at the end of the class!
