# Aquababies

### Who's Ready for Aquababies?
Babies 7-30 months who have completed private lessons and have acquired basic survival skills.

### Why Aquababies?
- Baby swimmers need to practice the skills they have learned for maximum retention.
- Toddlers experience the fun of water exploration within a relaxed group setting.
- Once a week, parents and toddlers interact with each other while they swim, float, sing and play together in the water.
- 

This class reinforces our philosophy of safety skills first, followed by water enjoyment and ultimately proficient swimming.
