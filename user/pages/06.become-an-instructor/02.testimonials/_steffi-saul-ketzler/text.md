"I'm thankful that I found Infant Aquatics and was able to go through their instructor training. The experience was incredible, consisting of 200+ hours of hands-on training with over 20 children daily in private lessons, and double the number in group classes. The training left me confident to start teaching my own students immediately, and each day in the water leaves me with a great sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.

"Personally, I like the independence of being able to run my own school but also know that help is always just a phone call away. Whenever I run into a challenge that I'm not able to solve by myself I can count on my trainer to give me timely, competent advice, which has never failed me. I have been a professional since I was 18 years old and always liked what I was doing, but being an Infant Aquatics instructor gives me more fulfillment in a career than I have ever experienced before."
