"Infant Aquatics affords me independence, freedom and complete control of my own swim school with no recertification requirements and ongoing financial obligations, I have the freedom of staying current in the field of infant aquatic survival by attending conferences of my own choosing and learning from other reputable instructors, which consistently enriches my individual program.

"The Infant Aquatics website presents an enhanced level of professionalism to any swim program. It is creative, informative, as well as easy and fun to navigate. After potential clients visit the website, they never fail to express to me how very impressed they are with it. This dramatically simplifies my initial presentation to them. I love the visual impact of the website as it educates parents about infant and childhood drowning prevention through professionally taught swim lessons.

"I am certainly proud and pleased to be a member of Infant Aquatics. For anyone looking to build a rewarding career working with parents and children, I cannot imagine not taking advantage of this extraordinary opportunity.""
