"I thank you for the honor and amazing experience of training with you. I have been involved in numerous educational programs, as student and as teacher. Now I am telling my friends how exciting and meaningful it is, for the first time, to train one-on-one with a Master Teacher--you!! Truly one of the best educational experiences of my life."
