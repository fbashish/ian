"I chose to train with Infant Aquatics because I found the company and its members to be very supportive, friendly and genuine. I appreciated the fact that Infant Aquatics adjusted to my schedule and was able to provide a high number of various aged children for my training purposes. The training was a highly educational experience and the continuous support is very valuable."
