a:2:{s:7:"content";s:4208:"<p>My name is Kim Emery. I grew up in Nebraska, where we spent the majority of our time at the pool and the lake. Learning to swim and water ski at a very early age, I became involved with swim team, lifeguarding and teaching swimming lessons. I passed on the love of swimming to my three children who competed with USA Swimming. I feel most comfortable in the water; it is a huge part of my life.</p>
<p>I have worked at Fit N Wise Community Wellness Center in Decatur, TX since they opened in 2000 and became Aquatics Manager in 2003. It is my passion to teach others water safety, water confidence, water fitness, and to be able to share my love of water with them.</p>
<p>I am currently completing my degree in Recreation and Leisure Studies and Minor in Recreational Therapy. I have taught swimming lessons to students of all ages 35 years; have 5 years coaching experience, 12 years aquatic fitness experience and 15 years experience in Aquatics Management.</p>
<p>After teaching a very popular "fun" parent-baby class at Fit N Wise, I wanted to offer more to our community. Since I taught my own son to roll over and float at 5 Â½ months, I started researching training programs for infant swimming. I found Bev Steinfink and Infant Aquatic Survival. Through her I have learned so much and am pleased to have graduated the Infant Aquatic Survival Instructor course.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching your child skills to "swim - float - swim"</strong></p>
<p>I teach babies at age 6 mo. to about age 4. Each lesson is conducted one-on-one with the instructor and individualized for each child.</p>
<p>Class sessions are short; about 10-12 minutes long. Lessons are tailored for the learning style of a young child and to provide a safe lesson. New students may start on any Monday as long as there are time slots available. The parent or caretaker will remain on deck to watch. I generally have the parent get in with the child and myself the first two days, to better bond with the child and let the child understand that he/she has the parents "okay" to go with me.</p>
<p><strong>Babies from 6-8 months through about 13 months learn survival floating.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>He/she will be taught to rotate from a face-down position in the water to a back float.</li>
<li>The baby will be taught to rest and breathe on his or her back until help arrives.</li>
<li>You can expect that the typical infant will attend 4 lessons per week for an average of 4-6 weeks to attain these skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>A child who is walking or very close to walking (usually anytime after 13 months to about 4 years) will learn a swim-float-swim sequence.</p>
<ul>
<li>He/ she will be taught to swim face down using arms and legs (I like to call it a "reach and grab" stroke); roll on his/her back to float, rest and breathe when he or she needs air; and then flip over onto the stomach to continue swimming until he/she reaches the wall, steps, or deck.</li>
<li>This skill set can be achieved with 4 lessons per week in about 4-7 weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NO AMOUNT OF TRAINING CAN WATERPROOF or drown proof A CHILD. We urge you to directly attend to your child anywhere around water. There is NO SUBSTITUTE for safe supervision.</strong></p>
