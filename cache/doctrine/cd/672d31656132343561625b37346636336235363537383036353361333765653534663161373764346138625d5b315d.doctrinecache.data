                <h1>Strokes n' Floats</h1>
<h3>The Right Foundation</h3>
<p>The swim • float • swim sequence serves as the foundation for learning correct stroke technique. Children who can swim and float are able to transition into stroke development with ease.</p>
<h3>When is Your Child Ready?</h3>
<p>This class serves as a transition between FunDays and Stroke School and is the ideal way to introduce more advanced skills to accomplished 4 year olds.</p>
<h3>Why Strokes n'Floats?</h3>
<ul>
<li>To continue your child's aquatic learning process using techniques that are an extension of the swimming and floating skills previously learned.</li>
<li>To keep the fun in swimming by combining beginning elements of backstroke and freestyle with the activities used in FunDay classes.</li>
<li>To empower your child with more proficient swimming ability.</li>
</ul>
