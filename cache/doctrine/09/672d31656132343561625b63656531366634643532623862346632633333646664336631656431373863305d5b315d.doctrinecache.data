                        <h2>Why Infant Aquatics?</h2>
<p>Children are naturally drawn to pools, hot tubs, lakes, ponds, streams, reservoirs and beaches. Despite a parent's best efforts at supervision, it only takes one head turn before an accident has occurred. Teach your baby or toddler to rescue himself in an aquatic emergency.</p>
<h4>Reasons to Get Started</h4>
<ul>
<li>You want your child to learn to swim and float in weeks, not years.</li>
<li>You or your extended family live or vacation around backyard pools or natural bodies of water.</li>
<li>You enjoy swimming and want your child to enjoy it as well.</li>
<li>You would rather take control of your child's safety than take chances.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Your Child Deserves the Lifetime Gift of Swimming Safety.</h4>
