<p>Alina Turk traveled from sunny California to snowy Colorado this winter to become our newest Infant Aquatics instructor. Alina grew up in Germany and has lived in the States since 2007. She is the mother of a 15 month old toddler girl. Her academic background in psychology and practical background with young children as a long time nanny, dog trainer and TagTeacher are a natural fit for our profession.</p>
<p>Alina is relocating to Connecticut where her husband will be attending graduate school at Yale. Alina will be teaching through her own swim school, Swim Babies Swim, in Connecticut and New York, as well as joining forces with Dena Blum-Rothman of Infant Aquatics CT. Her long term goal is to bring Infant Aquatics back to Germany and increase international awareness for our program. We are proud to welcome her to our esteemed international network of instructors.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
