<p>Home of Infant Aquatics
Boulder County, Colorado</p>
<p>South Africa is now home to Infant Aquatics! Brendan Varrie from Johannesburg completed his training with Judy Heumann in May. Brendan owns and operates a swim school with a staff of 5 instructors. He is the father of two young daughters with an incredibly gentle and tender way of relating to his students.</p>
<p>Brendan writes: "South Africa has horrifying drowning statistics due to our sunny weather and high number of swimming pools. There is a desperate need for this program particularly for young black South Africans who don't generally have access to swimming lessons and find themselves at high risk even into their adult years."</p>
<p>Ja'me Oliver Swim Instruction Ja'mie Walthall of Denver was Brendan's training partner. Ja'mie is both a master PADI &amp; SSI scuba instructor. While specializing in youth dive instruction over the last several years, Ja'mie become increasingly aware of the need for quality swim instruction and is thrilled to have the opportunity to now join the Infant Aquatics family. Ja'mie has a contagious, fun-loving spirit and her students loved working with her.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
