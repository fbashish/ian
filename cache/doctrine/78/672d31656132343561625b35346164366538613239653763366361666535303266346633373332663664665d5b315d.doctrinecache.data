<p><strong>SWIMSTARS OF DURBAN</strong> is home to the Infant Aquatic program, as well as teaching stroke correction in group lessons. Our teachers of group lessons are all experienced SSA certified Instructors and Claudia, as an internationally trained Infant Aquatic Specialist, runs the baby program. Drowning is currently the second leading cause of accidental death in children under the age of 4 years. In a matter of minutes, lives can be changed forever. Drowning does not happen because of a LACK of supervision but a LAPSE in supervision. Drowning is nearly always preventable with the proper skills taught. As a Infant Aquatics Survival Instructor, I provide these skills to children from 6 months to 6 years. Part of the program is about teaching children to become self-reliant in an aquatic environment. Each child will learn these skills according to their ability and learning style. The extensive practical and theory training that every Infant Aquatic Instructor undergoes, ensures that your child will have a knowledgeable, skilled, confident and compassionate instructor.</p>

<h3>ABOUT TEACHING</h3>
<p>Claudia is passionate about teaching babies and children to swim. Her knowledge and experience are evident in the success of her swimmers. "My goal is to ensure each child leaves my swim school as a safe, confident and happy swimmer." At 6 months, babies will learn to roll over and float on their backs. Once they are walking, they are taught the sequence of Swim-Float-Swim, whereby they swim, roll over to float to breathe and then swim again, repeating this until they have reached the safety of the wall or the steps of the pool.</p>
