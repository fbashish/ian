                <h1>Fun Days</h1>
<h3>Who's Ready for FunDays?</h3>
<p>Children 2.5 to 4 years who have completed private lessons and have mastered the ability to swim-float-swim.</p>
<h3>Why FunDays?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Children need to practice their skills to maintain confidence and improve retention.</li>
<li>Aquatic professionals agree upon the importance of play in the learn-to-swim process and the negative effects of time spent out of the water.</li>
<li>FunDays are an aquatic adventure that will change your child from a survival swimmer into a recreational swimmer, and perhaps even a swim team participant.</li>
<li>The structure and curriculum vary according to instructor, but include an exciting array of water toys, animal floats and games. Whatever the age or activity, your child will have such a good time that he probably won't want to get out of the pool at the end of the class!</li>
