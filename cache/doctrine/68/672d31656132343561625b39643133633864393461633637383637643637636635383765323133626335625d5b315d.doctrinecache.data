<p>The first weekend in November brought 50 certified Infant Aquatic Survival℠ Specialists together in Atlanta for the 2015 Infant Aquatics℠ Network Continuing Education Conference. The conference was an opportunity for instructors from five continents to make connections and enhance their teaching abilities, while hearing from speakers on a wide range of topics.</p>
<p>Tracy Creek MD spoke on Drowning in the Media. She stressed that the incidence of secondary/dry/delayed drownings making headlines is rare and that Infant Aquatics℠ lessons are the best prevention for drowning. The new Infant Aquatics℠ website was unveiled, and speakers addressed topics on marketing, business planning, social media tips, and water chemistry guidelines. An entire afternoon was spent at the pool, with demonstrations of group classes, a presentation on how Infant Aquatics℠ takes Swim•Float•Swim! to strokes, and an in-water troubleshooting session led by the Lead Instructor Team. Team building activities included a Q&amp;A session, a Family Feud game and a Margarita and Fajita dinner.</p>
<p>The conference was a wonderful opportunity for Judy to connect with all of her trainees and spend time sharing ideas with a diverse group of like-minded individuals. Together we are making a difference by saving lives around the world, one child at a time.</p>
<p>LindsayBoylanWhile the leaves were turning, Judy was busy training Libby McFarland from Fayetteville, Arkansas and Lindsay Boylan, who becomes the 6th Certified Infant Aquatic Survival℠ Specialist on the staff of Swim•Float•Swim! Their nurturing personalities and smiley faces were loved by parents and students alike. They were a terrific partner duo and we are proud to welcome them to the Infant Aquatics℠ Network.</p>
<p>Tuyen Ho traveled from Vietnam for an extended refresher training during September and October. Tuyen trained with Judy in 2013 and has already taught over 350 students in her country. How awesome it has been to witness her growth as an instructor and to see her talents on display in the pool. During her visit, Amyli Zhuang from China made a pre-training visit. It was exciting to spend time with both of these exceptional young women.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
