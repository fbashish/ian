<h3>Beyond Survival Swimming</h3>
<p>Once your infant, toddler or child has completed our aquatic survival swimming program, we encourage you to continue with age-appropriate group classes. Each class is designed to enhance previously learned skills, bring your child to the next swimming level, and achieve our goal of safe, happy, technically sound swimmers.</p>
