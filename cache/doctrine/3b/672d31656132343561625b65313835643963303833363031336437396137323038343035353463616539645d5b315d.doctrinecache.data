a:2:{s:7:"content";s:1530:"<p>My name is Melissa Stoll, owner of Cypress Aquatics. I have always had a love for water especially being raised in Texas. I love being surrounded by water whether it is on a beach, lake, or anywhere with a pool. Being a mother of two, I wanted to share my love for water with my children. Of course, safety was my number one priority and I wanted my children to learn to swim and be safe at an early age. I was first introduced into survival swim when my son was 8 months old. After researching several swim programs, survival swim was the only program willing to teach at such a young age. After watching the progression of my son through this program, I knew there was nothing else out there that could compare to learning these lifesaving skills. This program also brought me much needed peace of mind having this extra layer of safety.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I had a near death experience with my daughter that really compelled me to becoming an instructor. I am so blessed to still have her here with me today. At that point, I trained and immediately became an instructor. I have gained a huge passion to teach these lifesaving skills through my own personal experience. I understand the importance of water safety and how vitally important these skills are. Not only will I teach your children lifesaving skills, but also learn to swim in weeks not years by combining the swim float swim sequence.</p>
<p>I am currently teaching in Cypress, Texas. I look forward to meeting you and training your little ones to swim.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
