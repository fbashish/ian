I graduated from Texas A&amp;M International University with a Bachelors Degree in Psychology. I am a mother of 3 boys. Laredo is a very hot city during spring and summer, and we enjoy being in the pool to cool off. Because of this, in 2002, I decided to become a Swimming Safety Instructor in the American Red Cross. Since then I've been teaching children ages 3 and up and giving "mommy and me" classes for infants.</p>
<p>In 2010, I decided that I should train with Infant Aquatics. The Infant Survival Technique teaches infants from 6 months to 6 years of age, how to swim-float-swim in any situation. I completed a rigorous training program in Dallas, Texas, with Instructor Beverly Steinfink, R.N ; as my supervisor, over 100 hours in-water training and over 100 hours learning the physiology, psychology, and development of the child between the ages of 6 months to six years of age as they apply to swimming and water survival. The American Red Cross also certifies me in adult, child and infant CPR and First Aid.</p>
<p>Since then, I've been teaching year round courses to many children in Laredo, Texas. Then, in 2013, my family and I moved to Mexico City and I am happy to teach the technique with babies in the northwest area of Santa fe, Bosques de las Lomas, Interlomas, and Lomas de Chapultepec.</p>
<p>The second accidental death in Mexico for infants and children is drowning. In Mexico, 77% of drowning children had been seen 5 minutes before they feel Sin the pool. I feel it is very important to give children the ability to survive on their own in the water, and build a positive foundation for lifelong water enjoyment. I would love to share this gift of swimming with your family.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
