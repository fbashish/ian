<h3>Who's Ready for Aquababies?</h3>

<h3>Why Aquababies?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Baby swimmers need to practice the skills they have learned for maximum retention.</li>
<li>Toddlers experience the fun of water exploration within a relaxed group setting.</li>
<li>Once a week, parents and toddlers interact with each other while they swim, float, sing and play together in the water.</li>
<li>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This class reinforces our philosophy of safety skills first, followed by water enjoyment and ultimately proficient swimming.</p>
