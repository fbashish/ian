a:2:{s:7:"content";s:2041:"<p>As a nanny for many years I was fortunate to be able to observe several children of different ages attend survival-swimming lessons. Watching children I deeply cared for go through the process of learning not only how to swim, but survive in the water, made a huge impression on me. I knew that once I had kids, I had to give them access to such a course as well. It was clear to me how valuable it would prove to be for their safety and confidence in and around water.</p>
<p>Fast-forward a few years. My husband quickly came on board, and our daughter completed her first skill set training at 7 months old. This prompted me to develop an even deeper desire to be involved in this amazing mission in any way possible!</p>
<p>Several years of nannying, in combination with studying the behavioral sciences and teaching family oriented dog training, gave me a solid understanding on how to relate to children. Becoming a mom sealed the deal, and so the decision to become an instructor myself came naturally. After having been a rescue swimmer in high school, I can especially appreciate the accident prevention approach in addition to the confidence and self esteem gained with the acquisition of aquatic survival and swimming skills.</p>
