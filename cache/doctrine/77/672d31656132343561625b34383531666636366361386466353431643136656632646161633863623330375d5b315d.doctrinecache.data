                        <p>"The Infant Aquatics program is an intense 6 weeks filled with so much information and many challenges, but Judy is there every step of the way to guide you; giving you the knowledge and confidence you need to take everything you learned under her instruction and start your own program back at home. I am grateful for the opportunity to lean on my fellow Infant Aquatics instructors if I ever need help or have questions. Choosing this as my life long career was the best decision I ever made, it is the most challenging and rewarding thing I could have imagined."</p>
