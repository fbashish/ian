                        <p><strong>Grandma's Pool in the Autumn</strong></p>
<p>My 2 year old daughter Sarah was playing around the pool at her grandma's house. She fell backwards into the pool's deep end. Her 13 year old uncle was panic-stricken. He didn't know whether to run for help or try to jump in and save Sarah himself. While he yelled for me and decided what to do, Sarah flipped herself over, swam over to the side and pulled herself out. She was standing on the deck by the time I got to her. She was just fine, and she couldn't understand what all the commotion was about. I was absolutely amazed.</p>
