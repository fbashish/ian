                <p>"Becoming an Infant Aquatics instructor was the best decision I ever made. The training fee was a bargain and the rewards, both personally and financially have been substantial. I receive continuing advice and support, without any ongoing financial obligations or restrictions on the way I choose to conduct my business.</p>
<p>"The Infant Aquatics training instructors were accessible, encouraging, and responsive to my needs as a new instructor. They provided me with the in water skills and the marketing savvy to turn my summer business in a backyard pool into a year-round swim school with an indoor facility in less than 4 years. I urge anyone interested in this life-saving profession to consider the quality of instruction and no-strings alliance offered by Infant Aquatics."</p>
